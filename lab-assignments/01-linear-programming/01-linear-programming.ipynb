    "In this lab, you will explore a useful extension of linear programming duality (covered in class\n",
    "LP Day 1) called linear programming sensitivity analysis. Here, we aim to find:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does the solution change when the objective function changes?\n",
    "- How does the solution change when the resource limits change?\n",
    "- How does the solution change when a constraint is added to the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to these types of questions is solving lots of slightly different linear programming problems. This method would work, but it is inelegant and (for large problems) computationally expensive (but in most cases today, computation is cheap and computing solutions to many problems is a standard technique to study sensitivity in practice). However, there is a more elegant solution\n",
    "that gives these answers just by examining the dual information provided by the Simplex Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider the following scenario:** An instrument company makes trombones and trumpets. A trombone requires 40 square inches of metal sheet and a trumpet requires 30 square inches of metal. Metal costs $1 per square inch and 40,000 square inches are available. It takes two hours of skilled labor to make a novice quality trombone or a novice quality trumpet. Three more hours of skilled labor will turn a novice quality trombone into a professional trombone. Two more hours of skilled labor will turn a novice quality trumpet into a professional trumpet. There are 6000 hours of skilled labor available. Assume that you do not need to pay for labor. Assume that you can sell fractional trombones and trumpets. The market selling prices and production costs are given in the following table:\n",
