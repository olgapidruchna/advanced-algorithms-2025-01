    "\n",
    "### Knapsack Problem\n",
    "We are actually going to be looking at a specific (hopefully fun) implementation of the knapsack problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional knapsack problem asks you to pack a set of items, with given weights and values into a \"knapsack\" with a maximum capacity. You cannot pack more items than the capacity of the knapsack. The goal is to select a subset of items that maximize the total value with what can fit in the knapsack. The name \"knapsack\" comes from the similarity to a hiker trying to pack a bag without going over a certain weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knapsack problem is an NP-Hard optimization problem, which is why it is one of the classic approximation algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifications for this Lab\n",
    "The variation that we will be doing in this assignment is referred to as an 0/1 knapsack problem, meaning that items must be completely put in the knapsack or they must be left behind (you can't have a fractional portion of an item). We will be representing this as a simple fantasy sports league - specifically Formula 1 drivers. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with a list of F1 drivers and constructors with given costs and points as well as a budget of $100M. You will be selecting five drivers and two constructors (teams). \n",
    "\n",
